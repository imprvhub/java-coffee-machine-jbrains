# java-coffee-machine-jbrains
 This project allows us to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes, and get a taste of Java. Practice working with methods, challenge ourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP.

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, we will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. We can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
